# Redux and React Udacity exercise

This repo is a code-along with the second project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

This project is the react app version of the [Todos-Goals app](https://github.com/harishb93/redux-react-udacity).The point of this project is to implement a react app instead of a single HTML file and having a Rails-Style directory structure.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
